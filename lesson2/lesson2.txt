if-else in go
    - comparison operation
        - && (and)
        - || (or)
        - == (equal)
        - != (not equal)
    - must be like this because go want to clean and easy to read so will fixed format if-else
        if condition {
            statement
        }else if condition {
            statement
        }else {
            condition
        }

switch-case in go
    - must be like this and can be use with condition
        switch variable {
            case value:
                statement
            case value:
                statement
            defalult:
                statement
        }

        switch {
            case condition:
                statement
            case condition:
                statement
            defalult:
                statement
        }

    - fallthrough mean continue doing if match condition

loop in go
    - must be like this
        for init;condition;step {
            statement
        }
    - but can use alternative way for loop
        for condition {
            statement
            step
        }
